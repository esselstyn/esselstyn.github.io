**PI: Jake Esselstyn**  
I am a mammalian systematist with general interests in evolutionary biology and biogeography. My research explores questions of phylogeny, island biogeography, and taxonomy, but my students' interests expand the general lab efforts to include topics such as co-evolution and community ecology. All of our research relies heavily on voucher specimens held in natural history museums. As such, we place a premium on contributing to the growth, use, and value of museum collections. In recent years, we've collected mammal specimens in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Southeastern U.S.

**Mark Swanson** is a PhD student studying the evolution of rodents and their microbiomes, as it relates to dietary evolution. Mark obtained his Bachelor's degree from Illinois Wesleyan University. He has contributed heavily to our efforts to better understand phylogenetic relationships among all mammals and to our field program, including participation in four expeditions to Sulawesi.

**Jon Nations** is a PhD student investigating the ecomorphological evolution and community ecology of rodents. Jon received his Bachelor's degree from the University of Alaska. He is supported at LSU by a Graduate Research Fellowship from the National Science Foundation.  In addition to his own research, Jon has contributed substantially to our general goals by undertaking collecting expeditions to Malaysia and Indonesia.

**Spenser Babb-Biernacki** is a PhD student interested in co-evolution between mammals and their pathogenic fungi. Spenser has a Bachelor's degree from Arizona State University and is supported by a fellowship from the Louisiana Board of Regents. She is co-advised by [Vinson Doyle](https://www.lsu.edu/agriculture/plant/about/faculty-staff/doyle.php), a collaborator in LSU's Department of Plant Pathalogy and Crop Physiology.

**Heru Handika** is a PhD student interested in the biogeography and systematics of Southeast Asian mammals. He received his Bachelors degree from Andalas University and his Masters degree from the University of Melbourne. Heru has joined countless field expeditions, including work on Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Sulawesi, and in the Philippines. His Masters thesis examined the systematics and biogeography of *Bunomys*, a group of mice endemic to Sulawesi.
