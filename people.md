**PI: Jake Esselstyn**  
I am a mammalian systematist with general interests in evolutionary biology. My research explores questions of phylogeny,  biogeography, and taxonomy, but my studnets' interests expand the general lab efforts to include co-evolution and community ecology. All of our research relies heavily on voucher specimens held in natural history museums. As such, we place a premium on contributing to the growth, use, and value of museum collections.


## Grad Students:
![mark](images/Mark.jpg)  
**Mark Swanson** is a PhD student studying the evolution of rodents and their microbiomes. Mark obtained his Bachelor's degree from Illinois Wesleyan University. Mark has contributed heavily to our efforts to better understand phylogenetic relationships among all mammals and to our field program, including participation in four expeditions to Sulawesi.

**Jon Nations** is a PhD student investigating the ecomorphological evolution and community ecology of rodents. Jon received his Bachelor's degree from the University of Alaska. He is supported at LSU by a prestigious Graduate Research Felloship from the National Science Foundation.  In addition to his own research, Jon has contributed substantially to our general goals by undertaking collecting expeditions to Malaysia and Indonesia.

**Spenser Babb-Biernacki** is a PhD student interested in co-evolution between mammals and their pathogenic fungi. Spenser has a Bachelor's degree from Arizona State University and is supported by a fellowship from the Louisiana Board of Regents. She is co-advised by [Vinson Doyle](https://www.lsu.edu/agriculture/plant/about/faculty-staff/doyle.php), a collaborator in LSU's Department of Plant Pathalogy and Crop Physiology.

**Heru Handika** is a PhD student interested in the biogeography and systematics of Indonesian mammals. He received his Bachelors degree from Andalas University and his Masters degree from the University of Melbourne. Heru has joined countless field expeditions, including work on Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Sulawesi, and in the Philippines.
