**PI: Jake Esselstyn**  
I am a mammalian systematist with general interests in evolutionary biology and biogeography. My research explores questions of phylogeny, island biogeography, and taxonomy, but my students' interests expand the general lab efforts to include topics such as co-evolution and community ecology. All of our research relies heavily on voucher specimens held in natural history museums. As such, we place a premium on contributing to the growth, use, and value of museum collections. In recent years, we've collected mammal specimens in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Southeastern U.S.

**Carl Hutter** is a post doctoral scholar researching molecular evolution in rodents, as part of our project investigating rates of evolution in molecules, phenotypes, and lineages in the the adaptive radiation of Murinae. Carl received his PhD from the University of Kansas in 2019. His research interests include amphibian systematics and trait evolution, as it relates to environmental circumstances. Carl's Google Scholar profile is [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iVRhKXQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
